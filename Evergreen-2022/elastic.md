# Project Goal

* Improve search speed for staff while using the Evergreen catalog.

---

# A Brief History

* Evergreen Begins
* Rise of [Solr](https://solr.apache.org/) for discovery layers
* KCLS adopts EG, soon migrates to 3rd-party catalog
* Jeff G presents on Elasticsearch-driven mobile catalog (TODO link?)
* Bill starts proof-of-concept implementation
* Blake GH opens [LP1844418](https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/1844418)
* Angular Catalog development proceeds
* KCLS limited staff use late 2020
* KCLS general use late 2021

# What is Elasticsearch?

> Elasticsearch is a distributed, open source search and analytics
> engine for all types of data, including textual, numerical,
> geospatial, structured, and unstructured. Elasticsearch is built on
> Apache Lucene and was first released in 2010 by Elasticsearch N.V.
> (now known as Elastic). Known for its simple REST APIs, distributed
> nature, speed, and scalability...

# Why Elasticsearch?

* Similar use of Solr
* Ease of use
* Broad feature set
* Excellent documentation
* I liked the API
* Industry use outside the library world
* Clustering / Replication
* Open source w/ vendor support/additions

---

# Other Benefits

* Indexing speed
    * KCLS 1.1M records; 3.6M items
    * 4 parallel: 1 hour 45 mins
* Searches report total result count / no estimates
* Takes heavy search query load off primary PG Database

---

# What's Implemented?

### Angular Staff Catalog Only

* Keyword, Title, Author, etc. search
* Some Numeric Searches (e.g. not Item Barcode)
* MARC search

---

# Query String Examples

### Query String supported added to Keyword field

* Give me everything: 
    * \*:\*
* Give me the new stuff:
    * pubdate:2022
* Boolean Grouping
    * (kw:dogs AND (pubdate:2021 OR pubdate:2022)) OR (ti:cats AND NOT pubdate:2022)

---

# Local Additions & Modifications

* 'contains exact'  match opt
* MARC match option selector
* MARC regex search
    * .{24}[^6]{3}.{13}
    * [Graphic Novels](https://evgstaging.kcls.org/eg2/en-US/staff/catalog/search?org=1&limit=10&marcTag=008&marcTag=655&marcSubfield=&marcSubfield=a&marcValue=.%7B24%7D%5B%5E6%5D%7B3%7D.%7B13%7D&marcValue=graphic%20novels&matchOp=regexp&matchOp=phrase)

# Pending Features

* Search Results Highlight Support
* Sort by Populatrity
    * E.g. popularity adjusted relevance (but w/ pupdate as example)
    * Integer.parseInt(doc['pubdate'].value) * _score
    !json
    sort: {
        _script: {
            type: "number",
            script: {
                lang: "painless",
                source: "Integer.parseInt(doc['pubdate'].value) * _score"
            },
            order: "asc"
        }
    }
* "Did You Mean" (in progress)

* Load-balanced with one write node, one replica node.
* A full index uses about 36G disk
* Apply firewall (iptables) to limit port 9200 access

---

# Administration

* Indexing script runs regularly in the background.
* Create multiple datasets
* Debugging Indexes
    * curl -s http://localhost:9200/bib-search/_doc/891066 | jq -C . | less -R
* Configuration Files
    * /openils/conf/elastic-config.xml
